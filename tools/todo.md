# contests
# tagging
- [x] remove tag button
- [x] link to card tag page `/tagging#card=dog`
- [x] link to contest page `ranking#contest=theBestCard`
- [ ] list card images instead of names ?


# logging (for logging playtest information?)
  i imagine us logging a game completely. noting all the names cards were given and then unpacking the sounds into meanings/tags

# explorer? (for seeing card information)
- [ ] filter all cards by tag

- [ ] move firebase stuff to a single file `database.js?`
